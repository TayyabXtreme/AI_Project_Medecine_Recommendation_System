## üß† Abstract

Medical Recommendation System is an AI-based model designed to give appropriate recommendations for workouts, diets, and medication based on symptoms provided by the users. Acting similarly to a medical practitioner, the system checks a patient's symptoms and predicts possible conditions and recommends corresponding pharmaceutical treatments. Machine learning improves predictive ability and expands access to basic healthcare.
